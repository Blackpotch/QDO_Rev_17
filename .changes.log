*******************************************************************************
The powers that be have decided changes to the QDO were due. I've been given a 
word document and told to change the template to the QDO. Sadly these people have 
little understanding of the machinations of this application. Still the job awaits...

Identify which fields are still relevant and which are new fields.

Begin modifying the format of the QDO sheet with a view to preparing range names for
the next stage (coding) of the application.

word document. Whilst inpecting vehicles.
